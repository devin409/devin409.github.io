The images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries using different libraries.

## Image Slider

This is a simple image slider. It uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) library. Check the [examples page](https://swiperjs.com/demos) for more information of what you can achieve with it.
